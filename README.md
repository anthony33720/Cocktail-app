# Cocktail-app

## A. Scenario

Working as a private bartender for a company, private events and catering, we set up a drink menu according to the customer will, then we need to manually calculate, depending of the amount of guests, the purchase list, and it can be quite long and redundant weekend after weekend. So This app would be helping bartenders for this part of their work, secondly the app is very scalable for bar managers around the world, first for the supplies, then for the communication with their teams. Indeed the List part could very personalisable with pictures and ingredients, We could add functionality for syrup recipes or infusion etc, and the barmanager could add a list of worker to see his drinks. Maybe a messages function and other features in my head.
Also a basic display of the database with filters, all cocktails are clickable and render a little box with ingredients and steps, if I have time I would like to includes links for pictures or video tutorials

## B. I will be wroking on

Monday, I will be making the front end using react, the basic layout, functions, buttons and components for the functionning of the app. I will be done when the app is fully functionning with mock data, the pages render proprerly.

Tuesday and Wednesday, implementing the back-end, being able to render mock data to the front-end. I will also be working on the database, I will be needing 5 tables:

- Users Table: This table will store user information, including their credentials and any other relevant user data.
- Cocktails Table: This table will store information about the cocktails.
- Ingredients Table: This table will store information about individual ingredients
- CocktailIngredients Table (Many-to-Many Relationship): This table will establish a many-to-many relationship between cocktails and ingredients. It will store the quantities of each ingredient needed for each cocktail.
- UserCocktails Table (One-to-Many Relationship): This table will store the cocktails saved by each user. It establishes a one-to-many relationship between users and their saved cocktails.

Thursday need to be the display and layout day, I will use this opportunity to learn tailwind
